Harbor</a><br>
*Captured by Soviet Forces 30 March 1945<br>
As the Russian war machine pushes relentlessly onward, the harbor town of
Danzig falls under Stalin's watchful eye.  A flood of Russians assault the
town that is lightly defended by German troops.
<br><br>
At the beginning of 1945, Germany started evacuating civilians from Danzig.
Most Germans fled the city, many by seaborne evacuation to
Schleswig-Holstein. This happened during winter, under the bombs and in
constant danger of submarines.
<br><br>
On March 30, 1945 the Soviet Army seized Danzig. In the following days,
Soviet soldiers were given completely free hand in the city. In Danzig were
scenes of brutal violence, rapes, murders, and robbery, and eventually the
city was set on fire.

The official German history estimates that about 100,000 Danzigers - a
quarter of the city's prewar population - lost their lives in the war,
including the evacuation and Soviet capture of the city.

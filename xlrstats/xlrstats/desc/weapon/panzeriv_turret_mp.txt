Panzer IV f<br>
The main feature introduced with the PzKpfw IV Ausf. F was improved armor protection consisting of face-hardened, 50mm thick frontal armor on the hull, superstructure and turret, and 30mm thick sides. It became apparant that kinetic energy was the real tank-killer and what was required were guns capable of producing the high muzzle velocities. The short low-velocity 75mm KwK L/24 of early models of PzKpfw IV was replaced in Ausf. F onwards by longer-barrel weapons, much more effective against enemy armor as a hurried answer to the Soviet T-34. The Ausf. F2, armed with the the 75mm Kw.K.40 L/43, was exceptionally effective, and restored the balance of fire-power to the Afrika Korps in 1942. However Rommel could never get enough of them to restore the original dominating position of his Panzer Divisions on the battlefield.

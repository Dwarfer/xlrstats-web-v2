Arisaka with Sniper Scope<br>
The Type 99 Rifle (From the Japanese Kyuukyuu-shiki syoujyuu or Kyuukyuu-shiki tyousyoujyuu) was a bolt-action rifle of the Arisaka design used by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.
<br><br>
The Arisaka, like the 1903 Springfield rifle, was based around the basic German Mauser design, albeit with some local alterations. It utilized a cock-on-closing action, which improved the rate of fire from the standard Mauser cock-on-open design.

The Sniper Scope is an optional scope for bolt action rifles and some semi automatic rifles such as the M1 Garand.

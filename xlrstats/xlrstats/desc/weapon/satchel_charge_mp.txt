Satchel Charge<br>
A satchel charge is a demolition device, primarily intended for combat, whose primary components are a charge of dynamite or more a potent explosive such as C-4 plastic explosive, a carrying device functionally similar to a satchel or messenger bag, and a triggering mechanism; the term covers both improvised and formally designed devices.

In World War II, combat engineers used satchel charges to demolish heavy stationary targets such as rail, obstacles, blockhouses, bunkers, caves, and bridges. The WWII-era U.S. Army M37 Demolition Kit contained 8 blocks of high explosive, with 2 priming assemblies, in a canvas bag with a shoulder strap. Part or all of this charge could be placed against a structure or slung into an opening. It was usually detonated with a pull igniter. When used as an anti-tank weapon, one- to two-kg charges were sufficient to severely damage the tracks. Four-kg charges were enough to destroy medium tanks.

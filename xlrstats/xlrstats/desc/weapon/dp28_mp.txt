DP-28 Degtyaryov Machine Gun<br>
The Ruchnoy Pulemyot Degtyaryova Pekhotny (Degtyaryov hand-held infantry machine gun) or DP was a light machine gun used by the Soviet Union starting in 1928. It fired the 7.62x54mmR cartridge and was cheap and easy to manufacture - early models had fewer than 80 parts and could be built by unskilled labour. The DP was especially able to withstand dirt. In tests it was buried in sand and mud and was still capable of firing more than 500 rounds.

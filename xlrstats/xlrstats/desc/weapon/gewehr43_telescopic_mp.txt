Gewehr 43 with Telescopic Sight<br>
The Gewehr 43 or Karabiner 43 (G43, K43, Gew 43, Kar 43) is a 7.92x57mm Mauser caliber semi-automatic rifle developed by Nazi Germany during World War II. It was a modification of the G41(W) using an improved gas system similar to that of the Soviet Tokarev SVT40.

The telescopic sight in Call of Duty: World at War is very similar to the ACOG Scope seen in Call of Duty 4. As with the ACOG Scope, the telescopic sight increases a weapon's range, but impacts the weapon's accuracy (increased idle sway) and close quarter effectiveness (takes longer to bring the sights up).

M1 Garand with Flash Hider<br>
The M1 Garand (officially the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, M1) was the first semi-automatic rifle to be generally issued to the infantry of any nation. In 1936, it officially replaced the bolt-action Springfield M1903 rifle as the standard service rifle of the United States military (the M1903 retaining a valuable role as a sniper rifle), and was subsequently replaced by the selective-fire M14 in 1957. However, the M1 continued to be used in large numbers until 1963, and to a lesser degree until 1966.

Call of Duty: World at War's equivalent to the rifle silencers found in Call of Duty 4. They are available for all rifles (not bolt action) except the Gewehr 43, which has a Suppressor which is the same as Flash Hider but with better noise reduction. It is unlocked for a weapon after completing the Marksman I challenge for it.

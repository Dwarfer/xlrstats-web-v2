Double-Barreled Shotgun Sawed-off<br>
A double-barreled shotgun is a shotgun with two parallel barrels, allowing two shots to be fired in quick succession.<br><br>

The "Sawed-Off" feature is an attachment for the Double-Barreled Shotgun. It increases power, but decreases accuracy and range. It is very similar to having the perk "Stopping Power" in use.

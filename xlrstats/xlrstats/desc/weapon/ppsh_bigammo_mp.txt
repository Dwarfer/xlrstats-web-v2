PPSh-41 with Round Drum<br>
The PPSh-41 (Pistolet-Pulemyot Shpagina; Shpagin Machine Pistol; nicknamed Pah-Pah-sha, Shpagin and Burp Gun) submachine gun was one of the most mass produced weapons of its type of World War II. It was designed by Georgi Shpagin, as an inexpensive alternative to the PPD-40, which was expensive and time consuming to build. The PPSh operated with simple blowback action, had a box or drum magazine, and fired a 7.62x25mm pistol round. It was made with metal stampings to ease production, and its chrome-lined chamber and bore helped to make the gun very low-maintenance in combat settings.

Round Drum: This attachment available for the MP40, Thompson, Type 100, M1 Carbine and the PPSh-41 in Call of Duty: World at War multiplayer increases magazine size. It doubles the magazine size of a given weapon.

The exact name depends on the weapon, for the Thompson and the PPSh-41, it is called Round Drum, for the MP40 it is Dual Magazines, and for the Type 100 and the M1 Carbine it is called Box Magazine (though strangely if you have not unlocked the Box Magazine for the Type 100, it will say "Extended Clip" instead of Box Magazine).
